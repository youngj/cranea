           You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high
           up for your lamp to show it.  A cavernous passage leads
           north.  There is a hole in the floor through which you
           can see the Twopit room far below.

           You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream,
           which cascades over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring
           whirlpool that disappears through a hole in the floor.
           A passage exits to the south.

           You are dragged down, down, into the depths of the
           whirlpool.  Just as you can no longer hold your breath,
           you are shot out over a waterfall into the shallow end
           of a large reservoir.  Gasping and sputtering, you crawl
           weakly towards the shore.

           You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.
           An opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises
           rapidly upward.  The lake is fed by a stream, which
           tumbles out of a hole in the wall about ten feet
           overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere
           within the mist.  The only exit is to the south.

       <location id='69' title="Mirror room">
           You are in a circular chamber about 25 feet across.  The
           floor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.
           The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended
           from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided
           mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon
           walls.  A small window can be seen in the wall some fifty
           feet up.  The canyon has exits to the north and east.
