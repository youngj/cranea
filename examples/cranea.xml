        You are in what seems to be a storage room, with several

        An open doorway leads to a hallway to the north.

        receptionists' desk with a chair, and not much else of note.
        There is a large metal door to the south, and an office door
        to the north.  There seems to be an exit to the building to
        the east. There is also a maintenance door to the west.

          The first conventional-looking door you've seen in the whole
          place.  The handle won't turn, but there's a lock above it.  On
          the door, "William Dement, Ph.D." is printed.

        <action cmd='look exit door'>
          This door is locked, but it's not clear how one would
          open it.  There is no handle, no lock, no windows, no
          anything. You only know it's an exit door because of the
          "Exit" sign above it.
        </action>
        <action cmd='look metal door'>
          A sign on the door says "power generator" in big, scary red
          letters.  There's a button next to the door; otherwise there's
          nothing worth describing.

          This door is locked, but it's not clear how one would open it.

          a sign that says "Maintenance".

          The maintenance door has no handle. You try to push it, but

        <action cmd='south' dest='reactor'>

        same person as the Dr. Victor Dement you've been chasing
        all night. There's not too much else to report, other than
        a desk with a computer on it.

          What was it called again?

      You've finally made it to the Cranea power reactor room!  You
      can see the lifeblood of the Cranea organization behind thick
      glass. There is a console on the wall.
      <action cmd='look console'>
        <needs item='saveIt' />
        There is a small keyboard, a blank screen, and a big, red
        button marked "ABORT SELF-DESTRUCT".  There is a note taped
        next next to the console.
      </action>
      <action cmd='look console'>
        <needs item='blowItUp' />
        There is a small keyboard, a blank screen, and a big, red
        button marked "SELF-DESTRUCT".  There is a note taped
        next next to the console.
      </action>
      <action cmd='type'>
        Perhaps you didn't hear me clearly.  I said there was a BIG
        RED BUTTON next to the console.
      </action>
      <action cmd='push big red button'>
        There's only one button here. You might as well just say
        "push button".
      </action>
      <action cmd='push button'>
        <needs item='saveIt' />
        <takes item='buttonPushed' />
        Of course!  Pushing the big red button is ALWAYS the right
        thing to do. The console screen flashes, "enter password to
        abort self-destruct:".
      </action>
      <action cmd='push button'>
        <needs item='blowItUp' />
        <takes item='buttonPushed' />
        Of course!  Pushing the big red button is ALWAYS the right
        thing to do. The console screen flashes, "enter password to
        initiate self-destruct sequence:"
      </action>
      <action cmd='push button'>
        <needs item='saveIt' />
        <needs item='buttonPushed' />
        What, you want to abort the self-destruct twice?
      </action>
      <action cmd='push button'>
        <needs item='blowItUp' />
        <needs item='buttonPushed' />
        what, you want to blow it up twice?

      <action cmd='type'>

        <needs item='buttonPushed' />
        <needs item='saveIt' />
        <takes item='adventureDone' />
        
        As you start to type the password, you notice a sequence of
        messages on the computer:

        Cranea Reactor Control Log {time}
        vdement:login...{D} Done.
        vdement:test-proximity robot...{D} Done.

        9...{D}{D}
        8...{D}{D}
        7...

        You quickly realize that Dement is trying to destroy your robot
        in the reactor room, which would almost certainly cause the
        utter destruction of Cranea headquarters. Uh oh. {D}{D}{D}{D}{D}{D}

        4...{D}{D}
        3...

        Quickly you finish typing the password.{D}{D}{D}{D}

        1...{D}{D}

        The screen flashes:

        Self-destruct sequence aborted.
        Explosive deactivated.
        locate vdement:  Montara State Beach (last known location)
        Robot powering down...

        The robot powers off.

        Nicely done!  You've saved Cranea from utter destruction!
      </action>
      <action cmd="type schwaa" dest='evidence'>
        <needs item='buttonPushed' />
        <needs item='blowItUp' />

        Robot self-destruct activated.
        Burnination sequence initializing.
        Burnination in 10.... {D}{D}

        3...{D}{D}
        2...{D}{D}
        1...{D}{D}{D}{D}

        The robot transmits its final message, '4000CABRILLOBLVDJETTY', and
        you hear an earth-shattering kaboom as it self-destructs.
        Congratulations!  You've successfully destroyed Cranea Headquarters!

        Fortunately the Cranea servers and phone system are located in a
        heavily fortified bunker outside of HQ, so you should still be able
        to use them, as long as the (surviving) Cranea agents don't know that
        your team was responsible for destroying their headquarters...
